# MQTT v5 Client Filter Plugin for the CommsChampion Tools
This project is a member of the [CommsChampion Ecosystem](https://commschamp.github.io/) and implements
**MQTT v5 Client Filter** plugin for the [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt). It
allows observation and debugging of the custom protocol messages exchanged using
[MQTT v5](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/mqtt-v5.0.html) as the intermediate transport protocol in the common
environment of the [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt).
Please read the [wiki page](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt5_client_filter.cc_tools_plugin/wiki) for the instructions on
how to configure and use the plugin.

# How to Build
This project has several external dependencies. It is highly recommended to use the
[cc.cmake](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.cmake) project to bring in all the
necessary components of the [CommsChampion Ecosystem](https://commschamp.github.io)
together. Below are detailed instructions on how to build sources of **this** particular repository.

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as its build system. Please open the primary
[CMakeLists.txt](CMakeLists.txt) and review the available configuration options.

This project has the following direct and transitive external dependencies:

- [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) (**direct** dependency) - Primary library for any protocol definition, some inner cmake scripts are re-used in the build.
- [cc.mqtt5.generated](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt5.generated) (**transitive** dependency) - Definition of the MQTT v5 protocol (depends on the [COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms)).
- [cc.mqtt5.libs](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt5.generated) (**direct** dependency) - MQTT v5 client library (depends on the
[COMMS Library](https://github.com/commschamp/comms) and the [cc.mqtt5.generated](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt5.generated)).
- [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc.mqtt5.generated) (**direct** dependency) - CommsChampion Tools and its library required for the plugin development.
- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) (**direct** dependency) - Qt5/6 libraries.


All these dependencies are expected to be built externally and installation paths to the primary dependencies are 
expected to be passed to the `cmake` invocation
using the **CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH** configuration variable. Also the installation directory is expected to be the same as 
the one used to install the [CommsChampion Tools](https://github.com/commschamp/cc_tools_qt).
```
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/cc_tools_qt/install \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/comms/install\;/path/to/cc_tools_qt/install\;/path/to/cc.mqtt5.libs ...
```

There are [prepare_externals.sh](script/prepare_externals.sh) (for Linux) and 
[prepare_externals.bat](script/prepare_externals.bat) (for Windows)
scripts that can be used to pull and build all the required dependencies (excluding the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) libraries).

This project requires minimal **C++17** standard as well as Qt **v5.15** or above to get properly compiled.

# Branching Model
This repository will follow the
[Successful Git Branching Model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

The **master** branch will always point to the latest release, the
development is performed on **develop** branch. As the result it is safe
to just clone the sources of this repository and use it without
any extra manipulations of looking for the latest stable version among the tags and
checking it out.
